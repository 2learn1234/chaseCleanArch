# Android Clean Architeture (MVVM, Kotlin, Coroutine, Koin, Retrofit)

This is one of my public repository where I tried to create the clean architecture for Android development. The purpose of the project is to build a template Android project, where the necessary things are added properly. As well as I can use this repository as technical task/interview and project template.

I tried to build this application following these terms. which are:

- performance
- readability
- maintainability
- testability
- scalability
- simplicity


The tools I have used to gain the Android Clean Architecture are:

- MVVM
- Kotlin
- Coroutine
- Koin
- Retrofit
